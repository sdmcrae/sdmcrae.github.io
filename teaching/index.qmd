# Industrial Organization (Fall 2023)

This semester, I will be teaching two sections of undergraduate Industrial Organization (*ECO	14301	ORGANIZACION INDUSTRIAL*):

- Section 1: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:30 - 10:00 a.m. in PF107
- Section 2: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:00 - 11:30 a.m. in PF107

This course will study how firms compete with each other in imperfectly competitive markets. We will start with a brief review of the basic concepts from consumer and producer theory. The remainder of the course will focus on firms' price and non-price strategies in the case of oligopoly. Examples of the topics covered include price discrimination, collusion, horizontal mergers, predatory pricing, vertical restraints, product differentiation, research and development, and network effects.

By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:

1. understand the standard economic models for the analysis of imperfectly competitive markets;

2. apply these models to explain the real-world behavior of firms in the Mexican economy and elsewhere; and

3. find relevant questions and data for writing an undergraduate thesis or *tesina* in the field of industrial organization.

The required textbook for the course is Lu√≠s Cabral, [Introduction to Industrial Organization](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262035941/introduction-to-industrial-organization/), Second Edition.
