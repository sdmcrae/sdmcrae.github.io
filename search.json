    "text": "Industrial Organization (Fall 2023)\nThis semester, I will be teaching two sections of undergraduate Industrial Organization (ECO 14301 ORGANIZACION INDUSTRIAL):\n\nSection 1: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:30 - 10:00 a.m. in PF107\nSection 2: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:00 - 11:30 a.m. in PF107\n\nThis course will study how firms compete with each other in imperfectly competitive markets. We will start with a brief review of the basic concepts from consumer and producer theory. The remainder of the course will focus on firms’ price and non-price strategies in the case of oligopoly. Examples of the topics covered include price discrimination, collusion, horizontal mergers, predatory pricing, vertical restraints, product differentiation, research and development, and network effects.\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:\n\nunderstand the standard economic models for the analysis of imperfectly competitive markets;\napply these models to explain the real-world behavior of firms in the Mexican economy and elsewhere; and\nfind relevant questions and data for writing an undergraduate thesis or tesina in the field of industrial organization.\n\nThe required textbook for the course is Luís Cabral, Introduction to Industrial Organization, Second Edition.\nSyllabus"
